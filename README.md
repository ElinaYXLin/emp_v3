# Entropy Music Player (EMP) — v3

*The classic Entropy Music Player with better emulation!*

A music player that makes music feel warm, hazy and nostalgic. One **Macro** slider drives a whole chain of effects (saturation, tape, smear, reverb, granular memory and more), so turning a single control moves a track from clean to a half-remembered dream.

EMP comes in two editions:

- **Desktop (macOS)** — the main, actively developed version described below.
- **Web** — the original single-file prototype, kept for reference (see [Web edition](#web-edition)).

---

## Desktop edition (macOS)

A native SwiftUI + Core Audio app with a custom real-time DSP engine. It plays local music folders, or processes **any audio on your Mac** live through System mode.

### Requirements

- macOS 12 or later (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- Xcode 14 or later to build
- Optional, for System mode: [BlackHole 2ch](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) (a free virtual audio device)

### Build and run

1. Open `EntropyPlayer.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the **EntropyPlayer** scheme and press **Run** (⌘R).

Debug builds compile with optimization (`-O`) on purpose: the DSP runs on the real-time audio thread, and unoptimized Swift is too slow for it.

### Playing music

- **Open** a folder of audio files; play in **Alphabetical** or **Shuffle** order, or search tracks from the top bar.
- **System mode** processes everything your Mac plays (Spotify, YouTube, games…):
  1. Set your Mac's sound output to **BlackHole 2ch**.
  2. In EMP press **System**, then choose BlackHole as **IN** and your headphones/DAC as **OUT**.
  3. Grant microphone access when asked (macOS treats any audio input that way).

### How the controls work

Every effect knob is a **sensitivity**: how strongly the **Macro** slider drives that effect. Each knob also has a **Range** (min/max) that the macro sweeps through. In **Vibrato** mode the macro drifts slowly on its own (Slow or Fast).

Other controls:

- **Pre-Amp** and **Post-Gain** sliders: input trim and clean output volume.
- **Limiter / Compressor**: the final dynamics stage, with an always-on safety ceiling after it.
- **Presets**: 40 global presets grouped by vibe (Nostalgic, Calming, Inspiring, Dreamy, Playful), plus **INIT**, the defaults.
- **Save / Load Settings**: store your knobs, ranges and recipe as JSON.
- **Color** picker: the waveform color, also used by the Listener Report.

### Effects

Signal flow: **Spectral Haze → Temporal Haze → Color → dynamics → output**. Every effect is level-matched, so turning one up doesn't simply make things louder or push the limiter. The Lo-Mid EQ and High Roll-off are the exceptions, since changing tone is their job.

**Color**
| Knob | What it does |
|---|---|
| Lo-Mid EQ | Wide, gentle bell boost at 150 Hz (up to +12 dB) |
| Even Sat | Tube-style saturation biased toward even (2nd/4th) harmonics |
| Odd Sat | Symmetric tanh saturation with odd harmonics, for more edge |
| High Roll | Treble roll-off above 1 kHz, 0–6 dB per octave |

**Spectral Haze**
| Knob | What it does |
|---|---|
| Grp Delay | Low frequencies are delayed more (up to 20 periods: 200 ms at 100 Hz), with per-frequency scatter for a muddy, smeared low end |
| GD Random | Slow random drift of that delay (±50 %, 3–6 s glides) |
| Spec Blur | Each frequency swells in and lingers instead of starting and stopping sharply |

**Temporal Haze**
| Knob | What it does |
|---|---|
| Reverb | Convolution reverb with a tail that darkens as it decays; the knob is quadratic for fine control |
| Shimmer | Octave-down feedback glow under the music |
| Grain Echo | Short detuned grains replayed from the last ≤200 ms, like music echoing from memory |

**Bottom zone**
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| Saturator Recipes | 20 characters (Sweeten, Thicken, Vintagize, Glow, Velvet… and nostalgic ones like Grandma's Kitchen or Faded Polaroid) that reshape the saturators with emphasis EQ, tube bias and exact harmonic recipes |
| Hysteresis | Tape magnetic "memory": rounded, slightly compressed response with a head bump |
| Tape Sag | Loud passages make the tape dip in level, dull and briefly droop in pitch |

### Listener Report

**Listener Report** saves a shareable PNG card in your waveform's colors. It includes:

- **Score:** total harmonic distortion at 100 Hz and 1 kHz, measured through your current Color chain.
- **More measurements:** THD+N, 5-tone intermodulation, and time smear (clarity C50 and centre time).
- **Every setting as engineering values:** dB, Hz, ms and cents.
- **For fun:** a listener "archetype", a Cozy Index, and "Sounds like…" comparisons, which are vibes, not science.

### Listening-level meter

The bar at the bottom estimates how loud the sound at your ears is, in **dB(A)**, and tracks your exposure against the WHO safe-listening guideline (80 dB(A) for 40 hours a week).

- Enter your **headphone sensitivity** (dB SPL per volt), your **DAC's full-scale output** (Vrms) and your **system volume**.
- It shows a 1-minute level, today's time, this week, last week, and a rolling 7-day dose.
- History is saved locally (`Application Support/EntropyPlayer/listening_history.json`, inside the app's sandbox container) and survives restarts, sleep and unplugging.

It's an estimate; it's only as accurate as the sensitivity and voltage you enter.

### Listen responsibly

EMP's effects don't add loudness, but darker presets can tempt you to turn up the volume. Keep an eye on the listening meter, take breaks, and rest your ears if they ring or feel dull after listening.

## Web edition

`entropy_player_1.html` is the original browser prototype, a single file with no build step. Open it in a modern browser (Chrome works best) and load your MP3s.

It has the core idea in a smaller form: Macro slider, Reverb, Lo-Mid EQ and Saturator knobs with sensitivity and range, Limiter/Compressor, Vibrato, Shuffle, and settings import/export. Example settings files: `entropy_settings_1.json`, `entropy_settings_aug.json`.

The web edition is no longer actively developed. New effects, presets, System mode, the Listener Report and the listening meter are desktop-only.
